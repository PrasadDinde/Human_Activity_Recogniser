# Human_Activity_Recogniser

#### Human activity recognition using smartphone data involves using machine learning techniques to classify different physical activities based on data collected from the sensors in a smartphone. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKINGUPSTAIRS, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The goal of the project is to use this data to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the activities performed by the study participants. To do this, we will need to pre-process the data to extract features that are relevant for distinguishing between the different activities.
